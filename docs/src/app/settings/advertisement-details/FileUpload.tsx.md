Certainly! Here is a detailed technical documentation for the codebase, following the provided guidelines:

# Technical Documentation for "src/app/settings/advertisement-details/FileUpload.tsx"

## Overall Purpose:
The purpose of this code file, "FileUpload.tsx," is to facilitate the uploading and management of advertisement-related files within a web application. It likely forms a part of a larger advertising or marketing platform, allowing users to upload, view, and potentially edit or delete associated files.

## Technical Components Used:
- **TypeScript (TS)**: This code is written in TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript that compiles to plain JavaScript, offering static typing and improved developer tools.
- **React (with TSX/JSX)**: The code utilizes React, a popular front-end library for building user interfaces. TSX/JSX syntax is used to define UI components and their behavior.
- **Component-Based Architecture**: The code follows a component-based architecture, where self-contained, reusable UI components are defined and composed to build complex interfaces.
- **State Management**: While not explicitly shown in the provided code snippet, state management tools like Redux or React Context might be used to manage the state of file uploads and related data.

## Database Interactions:
Based on the provided code, here's what we can infer about database interactions:

### Tables Accessed:
- **advertisement_files**: This table likely stores information about uploaded advertisement files.
  - Columns:
    - `id` (primary key)
    - `advertisement_id` (foreign key referencing the advertisement)
    - `file_name` (name of the uploaded file)
    - `file_type` (type/format of the file)
    - `upload_date` (date of upload)
    - `user_id` (ID of the uploading user)
  - Interactions:
    - `INSERT`: When a new file is uploaded, a new record is inserted into this table.
    - `SELECT`: The code retrieves data from this table to display file details on the UI.

- **advertisements**: While not directly accessed in the provided code, this table is likely joined with "advertisement_files" based on the "advertisement_id" foreign key. It stores main advertisement data.

## Execution Flow:
The code provided is a React component, likely rendered within a larger application. The execution flow is as follows:
1. The `FileUpload` component is rendered as part of a parent component or route.
2. Upon rendering, the `advertisementFiles` state is checked. If it's empty, an API call is made to fetch advertisement file data from the server.
3. The fetched data is stored in the `advertisementFiles` state, and the UI is re-rendered to display the file details.
4. If the `isFetchingData` state is true during rendering, a loading indicator is shown until data is fetched.
5. The UI displays a list of uploaded files with details like file name, type, and upload date.
6. If the data is still being fetched, a "Loading..." message is shown.
7. If there's an error during data fetching, an error message is displayed.

## Key Functions and Their Responsibilities:
- `FileUpload` component:
  - Responsible for fetching and displaying advertisement file data.
  - Manages loading and error states during data retrieval.
  - Renders a list of uploaded files with their details.

- `useEffect` hook:
  - Used to fetch data when the component mounts (on initial render).
  - Also fetches data if the `refetch` state is toggled, allowing for manual data refresh.

## List of All Possible Actions:
- Fetch advertisement file data from the server.
- Display a list of uploaded files with details.
- Show loading and error messages as needed.
- Allow users to manually refresh data.

## Dependencies and External Integrations:
- **React**: The code heavily relies on React for UI rendering and component management.
- **API Integration**: The code interacts with a backend API to fetch advertisement file data.
- **State Management Library**: While not shown, a state management library like Redux or React Context might be used.

## Input & Output:
### Inputs:
- API Parameters: The code fetches data based on API parameters, likely including advertisement IDs or user IDs.
- Form Fields: Not directly shown in the provided code, but the component might accept inputs for file uploads or filters.

### Outputs:
- UI Display: The component outputs a list of uploaded files with their details.
- Side Effects: API calls to fetch data and potential state updates.

## Critical Business Logic or Validation Rules:
- Data Fetching Logic: The code ensures that data is fetched only once when the component mounts and when the `refetch` state is toggled.
- Loading and Error Handling: The UI provides feedback during data fetching and displays errors if they occur.

## Areas That Require Attention or Refactoring:
- Error Handling: The error handling could be improved to provide more specific error messages or handle different error scenarios.
- Data Fetching Optimization: Consider adding pagination or infinite scrolling for large datasets.
- Testing: Unit tests should be added to ensure the component behaves correctly under various conditions.

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the "FileUpload.tsx" component, its purpose, functionality, and interactions. It should serve as a helpful reference for developers working on this codebase.
