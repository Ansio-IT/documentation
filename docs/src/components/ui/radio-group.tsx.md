=# Code Documentation for src/components/ui/radio-group.tsx

Here is a detailed technical documentation for the codebase found in the file "radio-group.tsx" located in the "src/components/ui/" directory:

## Overall Purpose:
This code file is a part of a larger project and is responsible for creating a reusable radio button group component in a TypeScript React application. Radio button groups allow users to select one option from a set of choices, and they are commonly used in forms or surveys.

## Technical Components Used:
- **TypeScript (TS)**: Provides static typing for JavaScript, helping catch errors and providing better documentation.
- **React (with TSX)**: A popular library for building user interfaces. TSX is a combination of TS and JSX, allowing for the usage of TypeScript within JSX.
- **Functional Components**: The code uses functional components, a simpler way to write components in React that don't require a class definition.
- **Props**: The component utilizes props (properties) to customize its behavior and appearance.
- **State Hooks**: The `useState` hook is used to manage the internal state of the component, specifically to keep track of the selected radio button option.

## Database Interactions:
This component does not directly interact with any databases. It is a front-end UI component that handles user input and maintains its state locally.

## Execution Flow:
The `RadioGroup` component is designed to be used within a larger application. Its execution flow is as follows:
1. The component is imported and used within a parent component, which passes down the necessary props.
2. Upon rendering, the `RadioGroup` component displays a group of radio buttons based on the provided options.
3. When a user selects a radio button, the component updates its internal state to reflect the new selection.
4. The selected option can then be accessed or used by the parent component through the `onChange` callback function prop.

## Key Functions and Their Responsibilities:
- `RadioGroup`: The main functional component that returns the radio button group UI.
  - Props:
    - `options`: An array of objects, each containing a `value` and a `label` for the radio buttons.
    - `name`: The name attribute for the radio buttons.
    - `onChange`: A callback function that is triggered when the selection changes.
  - Responsibilities:
    - Renders a group of radio buttons based on the provided options.
    - Maintains the selected option in its internal state.
    - Triggers the `onChange` callback with the selected option when the selection changes.

## List of All Possible Actions:
- Rendering a group of radio buttons.
- Handling user selection of a radio button.
- Updating internal state with the selected option.
- Triggering a callback function with the selected option.

## Dependencies and External Integrations:
The component has no external dependencies or integrations beyond the standard React library and TypeScript.

## Input & Output:
**Inputs:**
- `options`: An array of objects, each containing a `value` and a `label` for the radio buttons.
- `name`: The name attribute for the group of radio buttons.
- `onChange`: A callback function that is triggered when the selection changes, receiving the selected option as an argument.

**Outputs:**
- UI Output: A group of radio buttons rendered based on the provided options.
- Callback Trigger: When the user selects a radio button, the `onChange` callback function is triggered with the selected option as an argument.

## Critical Business Logic or Validation Rules:
The component enforces that only one option can be selected at a time, ensuring the exclusivity of radio button groups.

## Areas That Require Attention or Refactoring:
While the provided code seems straightforward and functional, there are a few areas that could be considered for improvement:
- **Accessibility**: Ensure that the radio button group meets accessibility standards, such as proper labeling and keyboard navigation support.
- **Error Handling**: Add validation to handle cases where options are not provided or are malformed.
- **Styling**: Consider providing a default styling for the radio button group or allowing for easier customization through props or context.

Overall, the code appears to be well-structured and serves its intended purpose effectively. The suggested improvements aim to enhance its robustness and usability in a wider range of applications.
