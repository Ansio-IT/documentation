# Technical Documentation for src/lib/marketUtils.ts

## Overall Purpose:
The `marketUtils.ts` file is a part of a larger software system and serves as a utility library for functions related to market data and operations. It provides a set of tools and functionalities to interact with market-related data and perform various operations on it. The overall purpose of this code file is to offer a convenient and reusable set of utilities for developers working on market-related features in the application.

## Technical Components Used:
- **TypeScript**: The code is written in TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, offering static typing and object-oriented features.
- **Functional Programming Concepts**: The code utilizes functional programming paradigms, such as higher-order functions and immutability, to handle data transformations and operations.
- **ECMAScript Features**: Modern ECMAScript features are used, including arrow functions, template literals, and destructuring assignments.
- **Object-Oriented Concepts**: Classes and class methods are used to encapsulate related data and functionalities.
- **Design Patterns**: The code incorporates the Factory pattern to create market data objects, promoting flexibility and extensibility.

## Database Interactions:
The code interacts with the following tables in the database:

**Table: MarketData**

| Column Name | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| id | Unique identifier for each market data entry |
| symbol | Ticker symbol of the market |
| price | Current price of the market |
| volume | Trading volume |
| timestamp | Time of the last update |

**Database Operations**:
- **SELECT**: Retrieves market data based on the symbol.
- **INSERT**: Adds new market data entries when updates are received.
- **UPDATE**: Updates existing entries with new prices and volumes.

## Execution Flow:
The code is designed to be used as a utility library, with individual functions called as needed. The main execution flow can be triggered by function calls from other parts of the application:

- The code is imported and utilized by other modules or the main application.
- Functions are called based on specific requirements, such as retrieving market data, calculating averages, or handling updates.
- Market data is fetched from the database using the `getMarketData` function, which takes a symbol as input and returns the corresponding market information.
- When new market updates are received, the `updateMarketData` function is triggered, updating the database with new prices and volumes.
- The `calculateAveragePrice` function computes the average price over a given time period.

## Key Functions and Their Responsibilities:

**getMarketData(symbol: string)**:
- Purpose: Retrieves market data for a given symbol from the database.
- Input: A string representing the market symbol.
- Output: A `Promise` that resolves to an object containing market data (price, volume, timestamp).

**updateMarketData(symbol: string, price: number, volume: number)**:
- Purpose: Updates the market data for a given symbol with new price and volume information.
- Input: Symbol (string), new price (number), and new volume (number).
- Output: A `Promise` that resolves when the database update is complete.

**calculateAveragePrice(symbol: string, timeframe: string)**:
- Purpose: Calculates the average price of a market over a given timeframe.
- Input: Symbol (string) and timeframe (string, e.g., "1h", "1d").
- Output: A number representing the average price over the specified timeframe.

## List of All Possible Actions:
- Retrieving market data by symbol.
- Updating market data with new prices and volumes.
- Calculating average prices over different timeframes.
- Validating market data inputs.
- Handling market data updates in real-time.

## Dependencies and External Integrations:
- **Database**: The code interacts with a database to store and retrieve market data.
- **API**: It may integrate with external APIs to fetch market updates or perform other operations.
- **Logging Library**: A logging library is used to log errors and debug information.

## Input & Output:
**Inputs**:
- Form fields or API parameters: symbol, price, volume, timeframe.

**Outputs**:
- Market data object: { symbol, price, volume, timestamp }.
- Average price for a given timeframe.
- Database updates and error messages.

## Critical Business Logic and Validation Rules:
- Market data is validated before being stored or updated in the database to ensure accuracy and consistency.
- Input validation is performed to check for valid symbols, price ranges, and volume values.
- Average price calculations use a sliding window approach to handle time-based data efficiently.

## Areas for Attention or Refactoring:
- Consider adding error handling for database operations to handle potential failures gracefully.
- The code could be refactored to use a more advanced data retrieval pattern, such as caching or pagination, for improved performance with large datasets.
- Additional validation rules and error messages can be added to enhance data integrity.
