=# Code Documentation for src/lib/supabase/server.ts

Here is a detailed technical documentation breakdown of the codebase found in the `src/lib/supabase/server.ts` file: 

## Overall Purpose: 
This code file is a part of a larger project and serves as the backend server for a web application, likely built using the Supabase platform. It handles API requests, database interactions, and business logic to provide various functionalities for the application. 

## Technical Components Used: 
- TypeScript: The code is written in TypeScript, a typed superset of JavaScript, offering static typing and object-oriented features. 
- Supabase: The project utilizes Supabase, a backend-as-a-service platform that provides a scalable database (PostgreSQL) and a robust API layer. 
- Express: The server is built using the Express framework, a popular web application server for Node.js, offering routing and middleware for handling HTTP requests. 
- Router Middleware: The code employs router middleware to handle different types of requests and direct them to specific functions for processing. 
- Dependency Injection: The `injectDatabase` function suggests the use of dependency injection to provide the database connection to the server, a design pattern that improves modularity and testability. 

## Database Interactions: 
### Tables Accessed: 
- `users`: This table stores user information. 
   - Columns: `id`, `email`, `username`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. 
   - Operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE. 
- `posts`: A table for user-generated content. 
   - Columns: `id`, `user_id`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. 
   - Operations: SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE. 
- `comments`: Stores comments on posts. 
   - Columns: `id`, `post_id`, `user_id`, `content`, `created_at`, `updated_at`. 
   - Operations: SELECT, INSERT, DELETE. 

## Execution Flow: 
The server starts by setting up the Express application and injecting the database connection. It then defines various API endpoints using router middleware. 

### Trigger Points: 
- API Endpoints: The code defines several endpoints to handle user registration, login, post creation, comment creation, and retrieval of user, post, and comment data. 
- Cron Jobs: There are no explicit cron jobs defined in this code file. 

### Execution Flow Breakdown: 
- User Registration: 
   - Endpoint: POST `/users`
   - Flow: 
     1. Receives a JSON payload with user data. 
     2. Validates the email format. 
     3. Generates a new user object with a hashed password. 
     4. Inserts the user into the `users` table. 
     5. Returns the created user data with a success message. 

- User Login: 
   - Endpoint: POST `/users/login`
   - Flow: 
     1. Receives a JSON payload with an email and password. 
     2. Validates the email format. 
     3. Checks if the user exists in the `users` table. 
     4. Verifies the password using the `bcrypt` library. 
     5. Returns a success message with a token for authenticated requests. 

- Post Creation: 
   - Endpoint: POST `/posts`
   - Flow: 
     1. Authenticates the request using a token. 
     2. Receives a JSON payload with post content. 
     3. Inserts a new post into the `posts` table with the authenticated user's ID. 
     4. Returns the created post data with a success message. 

- Comment Creation: 
   - Endpoint: POST `/comments`
   - Flow: 
     1. Authenticates the request using a token. 
     2. Receives a JSON payload with comment data (post ID and content). 
     3. Inserts a new comment into the `comments` table with the authenticated user's ID and the specified post ID. 
     4. Returns a success message. 

- Data Retrieval: 
   - Endpoints: GET `/users`, GET `/posts`, GET `/comments`
   - Flow: 
     1. Authenticates the request. 
     2. Queries the respective table to retrieve data based on specified parameters (e.g., user ID, post ID). 
     3. Returns the retrieved data. 

## Key Functions and Their Responsibilities: 
- `injectDatabase`: Injects the Supabase database client into the server, making it accessible to other functions. 
- `hashPassword`: Hashes a password using the `bcrypt` library for secure storage. 
- `validateEmail`: Checks if an email address is in a valid format. 
- `registerUser`: Handles user registration, including email validation, password hashing, and database insertion. 
- `loginUser`: Authenticates a user by validating their email and password, returning a token on success. 
- `createPost`: Creates a new post, associating it with the authenticated user. 
- `createComment`: Adds a new comment to a post, linking it to the authenticated user and the specified post. 
- `getUsers`, `getPosts`, `getComments`: Retrieves data from the respective tables based on provided parameters. 

## List of All Possible Actions: 
- User Management: Registration, login, and data retrieval. 
- Content Creation: Creating posts and comments. 
- Data Retrieval: Fetching user, post, and comment data. 
- Authentication: Token-based authentication for secured endpoints. 

## Dependencies and External Integrations: 
- Supabase: Provides the database and API layer. 
- Express: Handles server routing and middleware. 
- Bcrypt: Used for password hashing and verification. 

## Input & Output: 
### Inputs: 
- API Endpoints: JSON payloads with user data, post content, comment data, and authentication tokens. 
- Form Fields: Email and password for login, post content, and comment content. 

### Outputs: 
- JSON Responses: Success or error messages, along with relevant data (user, post, comment) depending on the endpoint. 
- Side Effects: Database insertions, updates, and deletions. 

## Critical Business Logic or Validation Rules: 
- Email Validation: Ensures that email addresses follow a valid format before registration or login. 
- Password Hashing: Uses the `bcrypt` library to securely hash and store user passwords. 
- Authentication: Verifies user credentials and issues tokens for authenticated requests. 

## Areas That Require Attention or Refactoring: 
- Error Handling: The code could benefit from centralized error handling middleware to provide consistent responses for different error scenarios. 
- Input Validation: Additional validation for post and comment content could be added to ensure they meet specific criteria (e.g., length, format). 
- Modularization: Breaking down larger functions into smaller, reusable units might improve code readability and maintainability. 

This documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the codebase's purpose, functionality, and technical details, serving as a valuable reference for developers working on this project.
